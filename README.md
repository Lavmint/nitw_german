We're translating the game Night In The Woods into German with the [Dialogue Tool for NITW](https://github.com/captainsouthbird/NITW-Dialogue-Tool) (big thanks to [Captain Southbird](https://github.com/captainsouthbird) for providing this) and you can help us with that!

99 % of the texts has already been translated, but unfortunateley there is some more work on this! You can help in suggesting better translations for the game. Most of the content come from web translators :-)

It's still a bit buggy playing the game with these new files, because at some points the functions to manipulate the processes also have been influenced by our (auto-)edits.
However, the most important thing would be to correct logical errors by localizing and improving word jokes, idioms etc. into German in order to properly express the meaning and humor of this great game.

If you're interested in this adventure game, buy it on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/night_in_the_woods) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/481510/Night_in_the_Woods/) - it's still worth every penny to support the creators!
Here's a very funny attempt from Jello for a fully voice-acting of the game by doing a big [Let's Play with nice people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hVzG5sU5TE&list=PLjneAxn7bEer7GAgxBFzhZFBV5OAm_yMG).

## Setup 
- Install the [tool](https://nightinthewoods-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Editing_Dialogue)

- in the **Files** Tab of the tool "write" the text files "to the assets".
