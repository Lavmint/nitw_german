# nitw_german
translating the game Night In The Woods into German with the [Dialogue Tool for NITW](https://github.com/captainsouthbird/NITW-Dialogue-Tool) (big thanks to [Captain Southbird](https://github.com/captainsouthbird) for providing this)

Install the [tool](https://nightinthewoods-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Editing_Dialogue), download this repo into the **yarn** Folder and in the **Files** Tab "write" the text files "to the assets".

You can help in providing a better translation because most of the stuff I translated automatically via web translators :-)

It's still a bit buggy, because at some files the functions to manipulate the processes also have been influenced by my edits.
However, the most important thing would be to correct logical errors by translating and improving word jokes and allusions in order to properly express the meaning and humor of this great game.

If you're just interested in this nice adventure game, buy it on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/night_in_the_woods) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/481510/Night_in_the_Woods/) - it's worth every penny!

And here's a very nice attempt from Jello for a fully voice-acting of the game by doing a big [Let's Play with some funny people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hVzG5sU5TE&list=PLjneAxn7bEer7GAgxBFzhZFBV5OAm_yMG).
